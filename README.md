# Sentiment Prediction on Movie Reviews - IIT Madras (Kaggle Competition)

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a **Sentiment Prediction on Movie Reviews** project, conducted as part of the **IIT Madras BS Degree program** (May-Sept'23 Term, Diploma Level). The competition was hosted on **Kaggle**, where participants applied **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning** techniques to predict sentiment from textual movie reviews. 

### 🎯 Achievements
- **Ranked within the top 50** out of **700+ participants**.
- Implemented **various NLP techniques** for text preprocessing and sentiment classification.
- Applied **ML models** such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and deep learning-based approaches.
